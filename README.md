Klipfolio Metrics App
===================
- To run the app, download [MetricsApp.zip](MetricsApp.zip?raw=true). Extract it and edit the config.json file in the dist folder. Run MetricsApp.exe.
- All the options in the dropdowns are columns of tables. The klip table has extra options to parse the klipSchema.
- When a VALID partner public ID is entered, a new folder with the name "{partner name}-data" will be created with all the data in it, otherwise all data can be found in the "data" folder. These folders will be created in the dist folder.
- This is a very early version, so there will most likely be bugs, please let me know.

Running the Mac Version
=======================
- Download [MetricsApp.app](MetricsApp.app?raw=true).
